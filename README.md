## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**[zdoc](https://www.zdoc.app)** is a free tool that translates GitHub READMEs into multiple languages and keeps them automatically up to date.

Currently, it supports automated translation for documentation built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) and [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

This repository showcases projects whose documentation has been translated using **[zdoc](https://www.zdoc.app)**.
